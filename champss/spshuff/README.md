A python-bound library to read and write huffman-encoded L1 data dumps

populate ``makefile.local`` with the relevant fields (namely, a lib and include dir, as well as your desired installation python site-packages path),
then run ``make install-cpp`` or ``make install-python`` depending on the intended use case. 

Try copying an example ``makefile.local`` from ``site`` for a head start.

For a python install, run ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt`` (or do so as sudo) prior to running ``make install-python``.

see library documentation in ``docs/build/html/index.html``
